# Introduction
- Introduction:

- Problem that reactJS is fixing.
- If you don't investigate what problems that it is fixing, the solution is not going to make sense.

- ReactJS can make interactivity in a super simple way.
- ReactJS team focuses on that. 
- reactJS theme knows this
- After you make a comparision, you will see how ReactJS improved so much on JavaScript.

# Before React

- Before React, you had to do so many things to create a counter

1. Create HTML 
2. Grab from javascript
3. Listen for event
4. Update data. 
5. Update your HTML tags.

- This is too repetitive. 

```html

```
- in order to call react, you have to import two URL. 
URL1:https://unpkg.com/react@17.0.2/umd/react.production.min.js
URL2:https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17.0.2/umd/react-dom.production.min.js

# 2.3 Events in React

- React.createElement("<name of an element>", <EventListeners>, <content of the button>): This will create an element. 
- ReactDOM.render(<put multiple components>).
- Benefit: with one statement, you can create the element, an eventListener, and set the value.
